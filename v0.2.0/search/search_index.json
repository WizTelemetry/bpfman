Within bpfd, only a     single thread keeps these capabilities while the other threads (serving     RPCs) do not.</li> <li>Gives the administrators control over who can load programs.</li> <li>Allows administrators to define rules for the ordering of networking eBPF     programs. (ROADMAP)</li> <li>Visibility/Debuggability</li> <li>Improved visibility into what eBPF programs are running on a system, which     enhances the debuggability for developers, administrators, and customer     support.</li> <li>The greatest benefit is achieved when all apps use bpfd, but even if they     don't, bpfd can provide visibility into all the eBPF programs loaded on the     nodes in a cluster.</li> <li>Multi-program Support</li> <li>Support for the coexistence of multiple eBPF programs from multiple users.</li> <li>Uses the libxdp multiprog     protocol     to allow multiple XDP programs on single interface</li> <li>This same protocol is also supported for TC programs to provide a common     multi-program user experience across both TC and XDP.</li> <li>Productivity</li> <li>Simplifies the deployment and lifecycle management of eBPF programs in a     Kubernetes cluster.</li> <li>developers can stop worrying about program lifecycle (loading, attaching,     pin management, etc.) and use existing eBPF libraries to interact with their     program maps using well defined pin points which are managed by bpfd.</li> <li>Developers can still use Cilium/libbpf/Aya/etc libraries for eBPF     development, and load/unload with bpfd.</li> <li>Provides eBPF Bytecode Image Specifications that allows fine-grained separate     versioning control for userspace and kernelspace programs.
